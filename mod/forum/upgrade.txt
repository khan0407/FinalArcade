* mod/forum:allowforcesubscribe capability will be forcefully assigned to frontpage role, as it was mistakenly missed off
when the capability was initially created. If you don't want users with frontpage role to get forum (with forcesubscribe) emails,
then please remove this capability for frontpage role.
